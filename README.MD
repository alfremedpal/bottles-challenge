# Bottle Song challenge

As a part of an interview process I was tasked with "displaying in the console the lyrics of the song 99 Bottles of Beer". The complete instructions are:

> Write an **object-oriented** solution that displays in the console the lyrics of the song [99 Bottles of Beer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/99_Bottles_of_Beer). You can use your preferred weapon (language) of choice, ideally Python or JavaScript. Our goal is to test your Object-Oriented Design skills and use of design patterns. Ideally, your solution will be driven by tests.

## Requirements
